## What is ForTeamProjects?
As the name suggests, ForTeamProjects is a website for team projects in high school and college. Team project is one of the core activities that are carried out in every college in the world. One thing I noticed was that there are certain procedures that repeat in almost every team projects I've ever had. Sharing contacts, organizing tasks/links, and choosing when to meet. These procedures are normally done within a group chat or google docs. Having to ask emails & contacts everytime needed, having the links and documents scattered around, and most importantly choosing when to meet for online/offline discussion, all of these caused a lot of pain throughout my college years. Hence, I decided to build a website that could solve all these problems.

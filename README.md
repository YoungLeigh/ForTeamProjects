## What is ForTeamProjects?
As the name suggests, ForTeamProjects is a website for group/team projects in high school and college. Team project is one of the core activities that are carried out in every college. One thing I noticed was that there are certain procedures that are repeated in almost every team project I've had. Sharing contacts, organizing tasks/links, and choosing when to meet. These procedures are normally done within a group chat or google docs. Having to ask emails & contacts every time needed, having the links and documents all scattered around everywhere, and most importantly, choosing when to meet for online/offline discussion: all of these caused a lot of pain throughout my college years. Hence, I decided to build a website that could solve all these problems.
